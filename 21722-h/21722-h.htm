<h2>A
<br />PRACTICAL DISCOURSE
<br /><small>ON SOME</small>
<br />PRINCIPLES OF HYMN-SINGING</h2>
<p>What St. Augustin says of the emotion which
he felt on hearing the music in the Portian basilica
at Milan in the year 386 has always seemed to
me a good illustration of the relativity of musical
expression; I mean how much more its ethical
significance depends on the musical experience of
the hearer, than on any special accomplishment
or intrinsic development of the art. Knowing of
what kind that music must have been and how few
resources of expression it can have had,--being
rudimental in form, without suggestion of harmony,
and in its performance unskilful, its probably nasal
voice-production unmodified by any accompaniment,--one
marvels at his description,</p>
<p class="bq">'What tears I shed at Thy hymns and canticles,
how acutely was my soul stirred by the voices and
<span class="pb" id="pg_2">[2]</span>
sweet music of Thy Church! As those voices entered
my ears, truth distilled in my heart, and thence
divine affection welled up in a flood, in tears
o'erflowing, and happy was I in those tears<a id="fr_1" href="#fn_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.'</p>
<p>St. Augustin appears to have witnessed the beginnings
of the great music of the Western Church.
It was the year of his baptism when, he tells us,
singing was introduced at Milan to cheer the
Catholics who had shut themselves up in the
basilica with their bishop, to defend him from
the imperial violence:</p>
<p class="bq">'It was then instituted that psalms and hymns should
be sung, after the manner of the Eastern Churches,
lest the folk in the weariness of their grief should
altogether lose heart: and from that day to this the
custom has been retained; many, nay, nearly all
Thy flocks, in all regions of the world, following the
example<a id="fr_2" href="#fn_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.'</p>
<p>What great emotional power St. Augustin attributed
to ecclesiastical music, and of what importance
he thought it, may be seen in the tenth book of the
<i>Confessions</i>: he is there examining himself under
the heads of the senses, and after the sense of smell,
his chapter on the sense of hearing is as follows:</p>
<p class="bq">'The lust of the ears entangled and enslaved me
<span class="pb" id="pg_3">[3]</span>
more firmly, but Thou hast loosened and set me free.
But even now I confess that I do yield a very little
to the beauty of those sounds which are animated
by Thy eloquence, when sung with a sweet and
practised voice; not, indeed, so far that I am limed
and cannot fly off at
pleasure<a id="fr_3" href="#fn_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>:
and yield though
I do, yet these sweet sounds, joined with the divine
words which are their life, cannot be admitted to
my heart save to a place of some dignity, and
I hesitate to give them one as lofty as their
claim<a id="fr_4" href="#fn_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>
<p class="bq">'For sometimes I seem to myself to be allowing
them undue honour, when I feel that our minds
are really moved to a warmer devotion and more
ardent piety by the holy words themselves when
they are so sung than when they are not so sung;
and when I recognize that all the various moods
of our spirit have their proper tones in speech
and song, by which they are, through I know not
what secret familiarity, excited. But the mere
sensuous delight, to which it is not fitting to resign
the mind to be enervated thereby, often deceives
me, whenever (that is) the delight of the senses does
not so accompany the reason as to be cheerfully in
submission thereto, but, having been admitted only
for reason's sake, then even attempts to go before
and to lead. Thus I sin without knowing, but afterwards
I know.</p>
<span class="pb" id="pg_4">[4]</span>
<p class="bq">'Then awhile, from too immoderate caution against
this deception, I err on the side of too great severity;
and sometimes go so far as to wish that all the
melody of the sweet chants which are used in the
Davidian psalter were utterly banished from my ears,
and from the ears of the Church; and that way
seems to me safer which I remember often to have
heard told of Athanasius, archbishop of Alexandria,
that he would have the lector of the psalm intone
it with but a slight modulation of voice, so as to
be more like one reading than one singing. And
yet, when I remember my tears, which I shed at the
hearing of the song of Thy Church in the first days
of my recovered faith, and that now I still feel the
same emotion, and am moved not by the singing
but by what is sung, when it is sung with a liquid
voice and in the most fitting "modulation," then
(I say) I acknowledge again the great utility of the
institution.</p>
<p class="bq">'Thus I fluctuate between the peril of sensuous
pleasure and the proof of wholesomeness, and am
more inclined (though I would not offer an irrevocable
judgement) to approve of the use of singing
in the Church, that, by the pleasure of the ear,
weaker minds may rise to the emotion of piety.
Yet when it happens to me to be more moved by
the music than by the words that are sung I confess
that I have sinned (poenaliter peccare), and
it is then that I would rather not hear the
singer<a id="fr_5" href="#fn_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.'</p>
<span class="pb" id="pg_5">[5]</span>
<p>What would St. Augustin have said could he have
heard Mozart's Requiem, or been present at some
Roman Catholic cathedral where an eighteenth-century
mass was performed, a woman hired from
the Opera-House whooping the <i>Benedictus</i> from the
western gallery?</p>
<p>It is possible that such music would not have
had any ethical significance to him, bad or good.
Augustin lived before what we reckon the very
beginnings of modern music, with nothing to entice
and delight his ears in the choir but the simplest
ecclesiastical chant and hymn-tune sung in unison.
We are accustomed to an almost over-elaborated art,
which, having won powers of expression in all
directions, has so squandered them that they are of
little value: and we may confidently say that the
emotional power of our church music is not so great
as that described by him 1,500 years ago. In fact if
we feel at all out of sympathy with Augustin's words,
it is because he seems to over-estimate the danger
of the emotion<a id="fr_6" href="#fn_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>There is something very strange and surprising
in this state of things, this contrast between the
primitive Church with its few simple melodies that
<span class="pb" id="pg_6">[6]</span>
ravished the educated hearer, and our own full-blown
institution with its hymn-book of some 600 tunes,
which when it is opened fills the sensitive worshipper
with dismay, so that there are persons who would
rather not go inside a church than subject themselves
to the trial.</p>
<p>What is the matter? What is it that is wrong
with our hymnody? Even where there is not such
rooted disgust as I have implied, there is a growing
conviction that some reform is needed in words
or music, or both.</p>
<p>Assuming that the chief blame lies with the music
(as, I think, might easily be proved), I propose to
discuss the question of the music of our hymnody,
and I shall proceed on the basis of St. Augustin's
principles: I am sure that they would be endorsed by
any pious church-goer who had considered the subject,
and they may be fairly formulated thus, <i>The
music must express the words or sense: it should not
attract too much attention to itself: it should be
dignified: and its reason and use is to heighten religious
emotion.</i></p>
<p>One point calls for distinction: Augustin speaks
of his emotion on <i>hearing</i> the hymns and canticles;
he writes as if he had had no more thought of taking
part in the music himself, than we have of joining
in the anthem at a cathedral; and this might lead
<span class="pb" id="pg_7">[7]</span>
to a misunderstanding; for there is no doubt that
these hymns were sung by the people: the story
is that the very soldiers who were sent to blockade
the basilica, happening to be themselves catholics,
joined their voices in the stanzas which St. Ambrose
had specially composed to disconcert the Arian enemy.</p>
<p>The ecstasy of listening to music, and the enthusiasm
of a crowd who are all singing or shouting the
same hymn or song are emotions of quite different
nature and value. Now, neglecting the rare conditions
under which these emotions may be combined, we
shall, as we are speaking of hymns, be concerned
chiefly with the latter kind, for all will agree that
hymns are that part of the Church music in which
it is most desirable that the congregation should
join: and I believe that there would be less difference
in practice if it were at all easy to obtain good
congregational singing, or even anything that is worthy
of the name. It seems perhaps a pity that nature
should have arranged that where the people are
musical (as Augustin appears to have been) they
would rather listen, and where they are unmusical
they would all rather sing.</p>
<p>Speaking therefore of congregational hymn-singing,
and conceding, as I think we must, that the essential
use of such music is to heighten emotion, then, this
emotional quality being the <i>sine qua non</i>
(the music
<span class="pb" id="pg_8">[8]</span>
being of no use without it), it follows that it is the
primary consideration. If we are to have music at
all, it must be such as will raise or heighten emotion;
and to define this we must ask, <i>Whose emotion?</i> and
<i>What kind of emotion?</i></p>
<p>Let us take this latter question first, and inquire
what emotions it is usual, proper, or possible to
express by congregational singing of hymns. William
Law, in his <i>Serious Call</i>, has an interesting,
I may say amusing, chapter on the duty of all to sing,
whether they have any turn or inclination for it
or no. All should sing, he says, even though they
dislike doing so; and I think that what he affirms of
private devotion applies with greater force to public
worship. It should satisfy the most ardent advocate
of congregational singing, and it goes certainly to
the root of the matter.</p>
<p class="bq">'It is so right and beneficial to devotion, has so
much effect upon our hearts, that it may be insisted
on as a common rule for all persons; ... for singing
is as much the proper use of a psalm as devout
supplication is the proper use of a form of prayer:
and a psalm only read is very much like a prayer that
is only looked over.... If you were to tell a
person that has such a song, that he need not sing
it, that it was sufficient to peruse it, he would wonder
what you meant, ... as if you were to tell him
<span class="pb" id="pg_9">[9]</span>
that he should only look at his food, to see whether
it was good, but need not eat it.... You will
perhaps say that singing is a particular talent, that
belongs only to particular people, and that you have
neither voice nor ear for music.</p>
<p class="bq">'If you had said that singing is a general talent,
and that people differ in that as they do in all other
things, you had said something much truer.</p>
<p class="bq">'For how vastly people differ in the talent of
thinking, which is not only common to all men, but
seems to be the very essence of human nature: ...
yet no one desires to be excused from thought
because he has not this talent in any fine degree....</p>
<p class="bq">'If a person were to forbear praying because he
had an odd tone in his voice, he would have as good
an excuse as he that forbears from singing psalms
because he has but little management of his voice....</p>
<p class="bq">'These songs make a sense (of) delight in God
they awaken holy devotion: they teach how to ask:
they kindle a holy flame....</p>
<p class="bq">'Singing is the natural effect of <small>JOY</small> in the heart, ...
and it is also the natural means of raising <small>EMOTIONS OF
JOY</small> in the mind: such <small>JOY AND THANKFULNESS</small> to God
as is the highest perfection of a divine and holy life.'</p>
<p>Now though I cannot feel the force of all Law's
arguments nor easily bring myself to believe that
a person who dislikes singing, and has no ear for
music, will readily find any comfortable assistance
to his private devotion from making efforts to hit
<span class="pb" id="pg_10">[10]</span>
off the notes of the scale; yet I feel that Law's
position is in the main sound, and that he has
correctly specified the emotion most proper to that
kind of uncultured singing which he describes: and
though congregational psalm-singing necessarily
involves a greater musical capacity than that assumed
in Law's extreme case, and may therefore have a
wider field, yet we may begin by laying down that
<small>JOY</small>, <small>PRAISE</small>, and <small>THANKSGIVING</small>
give us the first main
head of what is proper to be expressed, and we may
extend this head by adding <small>ADORATION</small> and perhaps
the involved emotions of <small>AWE</small> and <small>PEACE</small> and even
the attitude of <small>CONTEMPLATION</small>.</p>
<p>In such a subject as the classification of emotions
as they may be expressed by music of one kind or
another, it is plainly impossible to make any definite
tabulation with which all would agree. The very
names of the emotions will, to different minds,
call up different associations of feeling. If any
agreement could be arrived at, it would be at the
expense of distinction; and all that I can expect
is to have my distinctions understood, and in the
main agreed with. And as I am most ready to
grant to the reader his right to a different opinion
on any detail, I beg of him the same toleration, and
that he will rather try to follow my meaning than
dwell on discrepancies which may be due to a fault
<span class="pb" id="pg_11">[11]</span>
of expression, or to a difference of meaning which
he and I may attach to the same word.</p>
<p>With this apology in preamble, I will attempt to
make some classification of emotions as they seem
to me to be the possible basis for musical expression
in congregational singing.</p>
<p>We have already one class: I would add a second,
to include all the hymns which exhibit the simple
attitude of <small>PRAYER</small>.</p>
<p>A third class I would put under the head of
<small>FAITH</small>. Examples of this class will no doubt often
cross with those of the first class, but they will
specify themselves as <small>CELEBRATIONS</small> of events of
various <small>COMMEMORATION</small>, introducing a distinct form,
namely <small>NARRATION</small>, which is a very proper and
effective form for general praise.</p>
<p>Also this section will include all the hymns of
<small>BROTHERHOOD</small> and <small>FELLOWSHIP</small>,
and of <small>SPIRITUAL CONFLICT</small>, with the
correlative <i>invitatory</i> and <i>exhortatory</i>
songs, as modified by what will be said later.</p>
<p>Also, lastly, under this same head of Faith, the
<small>DOCTRINAL</small> hymns, and professions of creed whether
sectarian or otherwise, which, if the definition be
taken widely, make a large and popular class, well
exemplified by the German hymns of the Reformation,
or by those of our Wesleyan revival; strong
with the united feeling of a small body, asserting
<span class="pb" id="pg_12">[12]</span>
itself in the face of opposition: concerning which
we will not speak further, except to recall the fact
that this kind of enthusiasm was not absent from the
causes which first introduced hymns into the Western
Church.</p>
<p>I believe that this is a pretty full list of all the
attitudes of mind that can be properly expressed by
congregational singing; and if we turn to other
emotions which are made the subject of church
hymns, we shall, I think, see that they are all of
them liable to suffer damage by being entrusted to
the rough handling of general vociferation.</p>
<p>Such will be all hymns of <small>DIVINE AFFECTION</small> and
<small>YEARNING</small>; all <small>LAMENTS</small> and
<small>CONSOLATIONS</small>; all descriptions of spiritual
conditions which imply personal experience and feeling,
as <small>ABASEMENT, HUMILIATION,
CONTRITION, REPENTANCE, RESIGNATION, SELF-DEVOTION,
CONVICTION</small>, and <small>SATISFACTION</small>.</p>
<p>Here I feel that many readers will be inclined to
dissent from what I say, and as I shall not again recur
to Law, I should like, in order to show my meaning,
to call up his extreme example of an unmusical
person singing in private devotion. If one pictures
such a case as he supposes, is it not clear, whether
one imagines oneself the actor or the unwilling
auditor, that while such an exhibition of joy might
perhaps pass, yet a similar incompetent attempt to
<span class="pb" id="pg_13">[13]</span>
express any of the last-named emotions would be
only ridiculous? But between this single worshipper
and the congregation the incompetence seems to me
only a question of degree; while in the far more
considerable respect of the sincerity of the feeling
in the hearts of those expressing it, Law's singer
has every advantage; indeed no objection on this
score can be raised to him. But now suppose for
a moment that he has <i>not</i> the emotion at heart
corresponding to his attempt at song, and I think
the differentiation of motives for congregational
singing will seem justifiable.</p>
<p>All these last-named emotions,--which I have taken
from congregational hymn-books,--and I suppose
there may be more of them,--call for delicacy of
treatment. A Lamentation, for instance, which
might seem at first sight as if it would gain force
by volume, will, if it is realistic or clumsy, become
unmanly, almost so as to be ridiculous, and certainly
depressing to the spirit rather than purifying. In
fact while many of the subjects require beautiful
expression, they are also more properly used when
offered as inspiring ideals; and to assume them to
be of common attainment or experience is to degrade
them from their supreme sanctity. But in thus
ruling them unfit for general singing one must
distinguish large miscellaneous congregations from
<span class="pb" id="pg_14">[14]</span>
small united bodies, in which a more intimate emotion
may be natural: and as there is no exact line
of distinction here, so there is no objection to
the occasional and partial intrusion of some of
these more intimate subjects into congregational
hymns.</p>
<p>To this first question then, as to what emotions
are fit to be expressed by congregational music, the
answer appears to be that the more general the
singing, the more general and simple should be
the emotion and that the universally fitting themes
are those of simple praise, prayer, or faith: and
we might inquire whether one fault of our modern
hymn-books may not be their attempt to supply
congregational music to unfitting themes.</p>
<p>To the next question, <i>Whose emotion</i> is this
congregational music to excite or heighten? the answer
is plain: It is the average man, or one rather below
the average, the uneducated, as St. Augustin says
the weaker, mind and that in England is, at least
artistically, a narrow mind and a vulgar being.
And it may of course be alleged that the music in our
hymn-books which is intolerable to the more sensitive
minds was not put there for them, but would justify
itself in its supposed fitness for the lower classes.
'What use,' the pastor would say to one who, on the
ground of tradition advocated the employment of
<span class="pb" id="pg_15">[15]</span>
the old plain-song and the Ambrosian melodies,
'What use to seek to attract such people as those in
my cure with the ancient outlandish and stiff melodies
that pleased folk a thousand years ago, and which
I cannot pretend to like myself?' Or if his friend is a
modern musician, who is urging him to have nothing
in his church but what would satisfy the highest
artistic sense of the day, his answer is the same:
he will tell you that it would be casting pearls before
swine; and that unless the music is 'tuney' and
'catchy' the people will not take to it. And we
cannot hastily dismiss these practical objections.
The very Ambrosian music which is now so strange
to modern ears was doubtless, when St. Ambrose
introduced it, much akin to the secular music of the
day, if it was not directly borrowed from it: and
the history of hymn-music is a history of the adaptations
of profane successes in the art to the uses of the
Church. Nor do I see that it can ever be otherwise,
for the highest music demands a supernatural material;
so that it would seem an equal folly for musicians
to neglect the unique opportunity which religion
offers them, and for religion to refuse the best
productions of human art. And we must also remember
that the art of the time, whether it be bad or good,
has a much more living relation to the generation
which is producing it, and exerts a more powerful
<span class="pb" id="pg_16">[16]</span>
influence upon it, than the art of any time that is
past and gone. It is the same in all aspects of life:
it is the book of the day, the hero or statesman of
the hour, the newest hope, the latest flash of scientific
light, which attracts the people. And it must be,
on the face of it, true that any artist who becomes
widely popular must have hit off, 'I know not by
what secret familiarity,' the exact fashion or caprice
of the current taste of his own generation.</p>
<p>And this is so true that it must be admitted that
it is not always the uneducated man only whose
taste is hit off. In the obituary notices of such
men as Gladstone and Tennyson the gossip will
inform us, rightly or wrongly, that their 'favourite
hymn<a id="fr_7" href="#fn_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>'
was, not one of the great masterpieces of
the world,--which, alas, it is only too likely that
in their long lives they never heard,--but some
tune of the day: as if in the minds of men whose
lives appealed strongly to their age there must be
something delicately responsive to the exact ripple
of the common taste and fashion of their generation.</p>
<p>All this makes a strong case: and it would seem,
since our hymn-music is to stir the emotions of the
<span class="pb" id="pg_17">[17]</span>
vulgar, that it must itself be both vulgar and modern;
and that, in the interest of the weaker mind, we
must renounce all ancient tradition and the maxims
of art, in order to be in touch with the music-halls.</p>
<p>This is impossibly absurd; and unless there is
some flaw in our argument, the fault must lie in
the premisses; we have omitted some necessary
qualification.</p>
<p>The qualification which we neglected is this, that
<i>the music must be dignified</i>, and suitable to the meaning;
and we should only have wasted words in ignoring
what we knew all along, if we had not, by so doing,
brought this qualification into its vital prominence,
and at the same time exposed the position of those
who neglect it, and the real reason of the mean
condition of our church music.</p>
<p>The use of undignified music for sacred purposes
may perhaps be justified in exceptional cases, which
must be left to the judgement of those who consider
all things lawful that they may save some. But if
from the mission service this licence should creep
into the special service, and then invade every act
of public worship, it must be met with an edict of
unscrupulous exclusion. Not that it can be truly
described as thus having crept in in our time. It is
always creeping, it has flourished in special habitats
for four or five hundred years, and before then there
<span class="pb" id="pg_18">[18]</span>
is the history of Palestrina's great reform of like
abuses. If in our time in England we differ in any
respect for the worse, it is rather in the universal
prevalence of a mild form of the degradation, which
is perhaps more degrading than the occasional exceptional
abuses of a more flagrant kind, which cannot
hide their scandal but bring their own condemnation.</p>
<p>There is indeed no extreme from which this abuse
has shrunk; perhaps the worst form of it is the
setting of sacred hymns to popular airs, which are
associated in the minds of the singers with secular,
or even comic and amatory words<a id="fr_8" href="#fn_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>: of which it is
impossible to give examples, because the extreme
instances are blasphemies unfit to be quoted; and it
is only these which could convey an adequate idea of
the licence<a id="fr_9" href="#fn_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
The essence of the practice appears to
<span class="pb" id="pg_19">[19]</span>
be the production of a familiar excitement, with the
intention of diverting it into a religious channel.</p>
<p>But, even in the absence of secular or profane
association, congregational singing, when provoked
by undignified music, such as may be found in plenty
in our modern hymn-books, may be maintained
without the presence of religious feeling, out of mere
<span class="pb" id="pg_20">[20]</span>
high spirits, or as we say, 'in fun,' and may easily
give rise to mockery. I have witnessed examples
enough in proof of this, but if I gave them it might
be thought that I wished to amuse profane readers<a id="fr_10" href="#fn_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>.
And though such extreme disasters may be exceptional
outbursts, yet they are always but just beneath
the surface, and are the inevitable outcome of the
use of unworthy means. The cause of such a choice
of means must be either an artistic incapacity to
distinguish, or a want of faith in the power of
religious emotion when unaided by profane adjuncts.
What would St. Augustin have ruled here, or thought
of the confusion of ideas, which, being satisfied with
any expression, mistakes one emotion for another?</p>
<p>The practical question now arises. We know the
need; how is it to be supplied? We require music
which will reach the emotions of uneducated people,
and in which they will delight to join, and in which
<span class="pb" id="pg_21">[21]</span>
it shall be easy to join: and it must be dignified and
not secular. If we condemn and reject the music
which the professional church-musicians have supplied
with some popular success to meet the need, what
is there to take its place? Of what music is our
hymn-book to be constructed, which shall be at once
dignified, sacred, and popular?</p>
<p>The answer is very simple: it is this, <i>Dignified
Melody</i>. Good melody is never out of fashion; and
as it is by all confession the seal of high musical
genius, so it is that form of music which is universally
intelligible and in the best sense popular; and we
have a rich legacy of it. What we want is that our
hymn-books should contain a collection of the best
ecclesiastical and sacred hymn-melodies, and <i>nothing
but these</i>, instead of having but a modicum of these,
for the most part mauled and illset, among a crowd of
contributions of an altogether inferior kind; the whole
collection being often such that if an ill-natured critic
were to assert that the compilers had degraded and
limited the old music in order to set off their own, it
would be difficult to meet him with a logical
refutation.</p>
<p>The shortest and most practical way of treating
this subject will be to give some account of the
sources from which the music of such a hymn-book
as I propose would be drawn. I will take
<span class="pb" id="pg_22">[22]</span>
these in their chronological order. First in order of
time are the Plain-song melodies.</p>
<p>I have already stated the ordinary objection to these
tunes, that they are stiff and out of date. Now it
may be likely enough that they will never be so
universally popular in our country as the fine melodies
invented on the modern harmonic system, yet the
idea that they are not popular in character, and that
modern people will not sing them, is a mistake;
there is plenty of evidence on this point. Nor must
we judge them by the incompetent, and I confess
somewhat revolting aspect in which they were offered
to us by the Anglo-gregorianists of thirty years ago,
a presentment which has gone far to ruin their
reputation; they are better understood now, and may
be heard here and there sung as they should be.
They are of great artistic merit and beauty; and
instead of considering them <i>a priori</i> as uncongenial
on the ground of antiquity, we should rather be
thinking of them that they were invented at a time
when unison singing was cultivated in the highest
perfection, so much so that a large number of these
tunes are, on account of their elaborate and advanced
rhythm, not only far above the most intelligent taste
of the minds with which we have to deal, but are
also so difficult of execution that there are few trained
choirs in the country that could render them well.
<span class="pb" id="pg_23">[23]</span>
To the simpler tunes, however, these objections do
not apply: in fact there are only two objections that
can be urged against them, and both of these will be
found on examination to be advantages.</p>
<p>The first objection is that they are not in the
modern scale. Now as this objection is only felt by
persons who have cramped their musical intelligence
by an insufficient technical education, and cannot
believe that music is music unless they are modulating
in and out of some key by means of a sharp seventh;--and
as the nature of the ecclesiastical modes is too
long a subject, and too abstruse for a paper of this
sort, even if I were competent to discuss it;--I shall
therefore content myself by stating that the ecclesiastical
modes have, for melodic purposes (which is all
that we are considering), advantages over the modern
scale, by which they are so surpassed in harmonic
opportunities. Even such a thoroughgoing admirer
of the modern system as Sir Hubert Parry writes on
this subject, that it 'is now quite obvious that for
melodic purposes such modes as the Doric and
Phrygian were infinitely (<i>sic</i>) preferable to the Ionic,'
i.e. to our modern major keys<a id="fr_11" href="#fn_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>. And it will be
evident to every one how much music has of late
<span class="pb" id="pg_24">[24]</span>
years sought its charm in modal forms, under the
guise of national character.</p>
<p>The second objection is their free rhythm. They
are not written in barred time, and cannot without
injury be reduced to it.</p>
<p>As this question affects also other classes of hymns,
I will here say all that I have to say, or have space
to say, about the rhythm of hymn-tunes; confining
my remarks generally to the proper dignified rhythms.</p>
<p>In all modern musical grammars it is stated that
there are virtually only two kinds of time. The
time-beat goes either by twos or some multiple of
two, or by threes or some multiple of three, and the
accent recurs at regular intervals of time, and is
marked by dividing off the music into bars of equal
length. Nothing is more important for a beginner
to learn, and yet from the point of view of rhythm
nothing could be more inadequate. <i>Rhythm is infinite.</i>
These regular times are no doubt the most
important fundamental entities of it, and may even
lie undiscoverably at the root of all varieties of
rhythm whatsoever, and further they may be the
only possible or permissible rhythms for a modern
composer to use, but yet the absolute dominion
which they now enjoy over all music lies rather in
their practical necessity and convenience (since it is
only by attending to them that the elaboration of
<span class="pb" id="pg_25">[25]</span>
modern harmonic music is possible), than in the
undesirability (in itself) or unmusical character of
melody which ignores them. In the matter of hymn-melodies
an unbarred rhythm has very decided
advantages over a barred rhythm. In the former
the melody has its own way, and dances at liberty
with the voice and sense; in barred time it has its
accents squared out beforehand, and makes steadily
for its predetermined beat, plumping down, as one
may say, on the first note of every bar whether it
will or no. Sing to any one a Plain-song melody,
<i>Ad coenam Agni</i> for instance, once or twice, and
then Croft's 148th Psalm<a id="fr_12" href="#fn_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>. Croft will be undeniably
fine and impressive, but he provokes a smile: his
tune is like a diagram beside a flower.</p>
<p>Now in this matter of rhythm our hymn-book
compilers, since the seventeenth century, have done
us a vast injury. They have reduced all hymns to
the common times. Their procedure was, I suppose,
dictated by some argument such as this: 'The
people must have what they can understand: they
only understand the simple two and three time:
<i>ergo</i> we must reduce all the tunes to these measures.'
Or again, 'It will be easier for them to have all the
<span class="pb" id="pg_26">[26]</span>
tunes as much alike as possible: therefore let us make
them all alike, and write them all in equal minims.'</p>
<p>Both these ideas are absolutely wrong. A hymn-tune,
which they hastily assume to be the commonest
and lowest form of music, actually possesses liberties
coveted by other music<a id="fr_13" href="#fn_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>. It is a short melody,
committed to memory, and frequently repeated:
there is no reason why it should submit to any of
the time-conveniences of orchestral music: there
is no reason why its rhythm should not be completely
free; nor is there any <i>a priori</i> necessity why
<span class="pb" id="pg_27">[27]</span>
any one tune should be exactly like another in rhythm.
It will be learned by the ear (most often in childhood),
be known and loved for its own sake, and
blended in the heart with the words which interpret
it: and this advantage was instinctively felt by
those of our early church composers who, already
understanding something of the value of barred
music, yet deliberately avoided cramping the rhythms
of their hymn-tunes by too great subservience to it<a id="fr_14" href="#fn_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>.
One of the first duties therefore which we owe to
hymn-melodies is the restoration of their free and
original rhythms, keeping them as varied as possible:
the Plain-song melodies must be left unbarred and
be taught as free rhythms, and all other fine tunes
which are worth using should be preserved in their
original rhythm; because free rhythm is better, and
its variety is good, and because the attraction of
a hymn-melody lies in its individual character and
expression, and not at all in its time-likeness to
other tunes. This last idea has been a chief cause
in the degradation of our hymns.</p>
<p>I may conclude then that the best of these simpler
<span class="pb" id="pg_28">[28]</span>
Plain-song tunes are very fit for congregational use.
They should be offered as pure melody in free rhythm
and sung in unison: their accompaniment must
not be entrusted to a modern grammarian. It is
well also to use most of them in their English form,
the <i>Old Sarum Use</i> as it is called; which happily
preserves to us a national tradition, in the opinion
of some experts older and more correct than any
known on the continent; and if the differences in
our English version are not due to purity of tradition,
they will have another and almost greater interest, as
venerable records of the genius of our national taste.
These Plain-song tunes have probably a long future before
them; since, apart from their merit, they are indissolubly
associated with the most ancient Latin hymns,
some of which are the very best hymns of the Church.</p>
<p>The next class of tunes<a id="fr_15" href="#fn_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
is that of the <span class="sc">Reformation</span>
hymns, English, French, and German, dating from
about 1550 to some way on in the seventeenth century.
The chief English group is known as <i>Sternhold and
Hopkins' Psalter</i>, which was mostly of eight-line
tunes. This book was virtually put together in
Geneva about 1560, and antiquarians make much
of it. If stripped, however, of its stolen plumes and
<span class="pb" id="pg_29">[29]</span>
later additions it is really an almost worthless affair,
the true history of it being as follows. A French
musician named Louis Bourgeois, whom Calvin
brought with him to Geneva in 1541, turned out
to be an extraordinary genius in melody; he remained
at Geneva about fifteen years, and in that
time compiled a Psalter of eighty-five tunes, almost
all of which are of great merit, and many of the
very highest excellence. The splendour of his work,
which was merely appreciated as useful at the time,
was soon obscured, for immediately on his leaving
Geneva, the French Psalter was completed by inferior
hands, whose work, being mixed in with his, lowered
the average of the whole book enormously, and
Bourgeois' work was never distinguished until,
quite lately, the period of his office was investigated
and compared with the succeeding editions of his
book. Now the English refugees compiled their
'Sternhold and Hopkins' at Geneva, in imitation
of the French, during the time of Bourgeois' residence,
and took over a number of the French tunes;
though they <i>mauled these most unmercifully</i> to bring
them down to the measure of their doggerel psalms,
yet even after this barbarous treatment Bourgeois'
spoilt tunes were still far better than what they
made for themselves, and sufficient not only to float
their book into credit, but to kindle the confused
<span class="pb" id="pg_30">[30]</span>
enthusiasm of subsequent English antiquarians, whose
blind leadership has had some half-hearted following.
But if these French tunes, and those which are
pieced in imitation of Bourgeois, be extracted from
this English Psalter, then, with one or two exceptions,
there will remain hardly anything of value<a id="fr_16" href="#fn_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>To leave the English tunes for a moment and
continue the subject, we shall practically exhaust
the French branch of this class by saying that our
duty by them is to use a great number of Bourgeois'
tunes, <i>restoring their original form</i>. They are
masterpieces
<span class="pb" id="pg_31">[31]</span>
which have remained popular on the continent
from the first; thoroughly congenial to our national
taste, and the best that can be imagined for solemn
congregational singing of the kind which we might
expect in England. The difficulty is the same that
beset the old original psalter-makers, i.e. to find
words to suit their varied measures. But this must
be done<a id="fr_17" href="#fn_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>. These tunes in dignity, solemnity, pathos,
and melodic solidity leave nothing to desire.</p>
<p>The English eight-line tunes of Sternhold and
Hopkins we may then, with one or two exceptions,
dismiss to neglect; but among the four-line 'common'
tunes which gradually ousted them, there are
about a dozen of high merit: these being popular
still at the present day require no notice, except to
<span class="pb" id="pg_32">[32]</span>
32
insist that they should be well harmonized in the
manner of their date, and generally have the long
initials and finals of all their lines observed. They
are much finer than any one would guess from their
usual dull presentment. Their manner, as loved
and praised by Burns, is excellent, and there is no
call to alter it<a id="fr_18" href="#fn_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Contemporary with this group there is a legacy of
a dozen and more fine tunes composed by Tallis and
Orlando Gibbons, the neglect or treatment of which
is equally disgraceful to all concerned.</p>
<p>As for the German tunes of the Reformation,
attempts to introduce the German church-chorales
into anything like general use in England have
never, so far as I know, been successful, owing,
I suppose, to a difference in the melodic sense of the
two nations. But some few of them are really
popular, and more would be if they were properly
presented with suitable words; and it should not be
a difficult task to provide words even more suitable
and kind than the original German, which seldom
observes an intelligent, dignified and consistent
<span class="pb" id="pg_33">[33]</span>
mood. These chorales should be sung very slow
indeed, and will admit of much accompaniment.
Bach's settings, when not too elaborate or of
impossible compass in the parts, may be well used
where the choir is numerically strong. He has made
these chorales peculiarly his own, and, in accepting
his interpretation of them, we are only acquiescing
in a universal judgement, while we make an exception
in favour of genius; for as a general rule (which will
of course apply to those chorales which we do not
use in Bach's version), all the music of this
Reformation period must be harmonized strictly in the
vocal counterpoint which prevailed at the end of the
sixteenth century; since that is not only its proper
musical interpretation, but it is also the ecclesiastical
style <i>par excellence</i>, the field of which may reasonably
be extended, but by no means contracted. It is
suitable both for simple and elaborate settings, for
hymns of praise or of the more intimate ideal
emotions, and in a resonant building a choir of six
voices can produce complete effects with it. The
broad, sonorous swell of its harmonious intervals
floods the air with peaceful power, very unlike the
broken sea of Bach's chromatics, which, to produce
anything like an equal effect of sound, needs to be
powerfully excited.</p>
<p>It is necessary to insist strongly on one caution,
<span class="pb" id="pg_34">[34]</span>
viz. that grammar is not style, and settings which
avoid modernisms are not for that reason a fair
presentation of the old manner. Nothing is less
like a fine work of art than its incompetent imitation.
And this practically exhausts, as far as I am aware,
the material which this period provides.</p>
<p>The next class will be made up of our <span class="sc">Restoration</span>
hymns, by Jeremy Clark, Croft, and others who
added to the succeeding editions of the metrical
Psalms. If there are not many in this class, yet the
few are good; and Clark must be regarded as the
inventor of the modern English hymn-tune, regarded,
that is, as a pure melody in the scale with harmonic
interpretation of instrumental rather than true vocal
suggestion. His tunes are pathetic, melodious, and
of truly national and popular character, the best of
them almost unaccountably free from the indefinable
secular taint that such qualities are apt to introduce,
and which the bad following of his example did very
quickly introduce in the hands of less sensitive
artists. They are suitable for evening services.</p>
<p>After this time there followed in England, in the
wake of Handel, a degradation of style which is now
completely discredited. Diatonic flow, with tediously
orthodox modulation, overburdened with conventional
graces, describe these innumerable and indistinguishable
productions. And just as the old tunes were
<span class="pb" id="pg_35">[35]</span>
related to the motets and madrigals, so are these to
the verse-anthems and glees of their time. These
weak ditties, in the admired manner of Lord
Mornington, were typically performed by the genteel
pupils of the local musician, who, gathered round
him beneath the laughing cherubs of the organ case,
warbled by abundant candlelight to their respectful
audience with a graceful execution that rivalled the
weekday performances of <i>Celia's Arbour</i> and the
<i>Spotted Snakes</i>. Good tunes may be written at any
time, for style is independent of fashion; but there
are very few exceptions to the complete and unregretted
disappearance of all the tunes of this date.</p>
<p>We have then nothing left for us to do but to
review the material which the revival of music in
the last fifty years has given us in the way of hymns.</p>
<p>This last group divides naturally into two main
heads; first the restoration of old hymns of all kinds,
with their plain, severer manner, in reaction against
the abused graces; and secondly the appearance of
a vast quantity of new hymns.</p>
<p>Concerning the restoration of the old hymns, we
cannot be too grateful to those who pointed the right
way, and, according to their knowledge and the
opportunities of the taste of their day, did the best
that they could. But, as our remarks under the
<span class="pb" id="pg_36">[36]</span>
heads of Plain-song and Reformation hymns will
show, this knowledge, taste, and opportunity were
insufficient, and all their work requires to be done
afresh.</p>
<p>We are therefore left to the examination of the
modern hymns. In place of this somewhat invidious
task, I propose to make a few remarks on the general
question of the introduction of modern harmony
into ecclesiastical music, with reference of course to
hymns only. It cannot escape the attention of any
one that the modern church music has for one chief
differentiation the profuse employment of pathetic
chords, the effect of which is often disastrous to the
feelings.</p>
<p>Comparing a modern hymn-tune in this style with
some fine setting of an old tune in the diatonic
ecclesiastical manner, one might attribute the
superiority of the old music entirely to its harmonic
system; but I think this would be wrong.</p>
<p>It is a characteristic of all early art to be
<i>impersonal</i><a id="fr_19" href="#fn_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>.
As long as an art is growing, artists are engaged in
rivalry to develop the new inventions in a scientific
manner, and individual personality is not called out.
<span class="pb" id="pg_37">[37]</span>
With the exhaustion of the means in the attainment
of perfection a new stage is reached, in which
individual expression is prominent, and seems to
take the place of the scientific impersonal interest
which aimed at nothing but beauty: so that the chief
distinction between early and late art is that the
former is impersonal, the latter personal.</p>
<p>Turning now to the subject of ecclesiastical music,
and comparing thus Palestrina with Beethoven or
Mozart, is it not at once apparent that Palestrina
has this distinct advantage, namely, that he seems
not to interfere at all with, or add anything to, the
sacred words? His early musical art is impersonal,
what the musicians call 'pure music'; and if he is
setting the phrases of the Liturgy or Holy Scriptures,
we are not aware of any adjunct; it seems rather as
if the sacred words had suddenly become musical.
Not so with Mozart or Beethoven; we may prefer
their music, but it has interfered with the sacred
words, it has, in fact, added a personality.</p>
<p>It must of course be conceded that this gives a
very strong if not logically an almost unassailable
position to those who would confine sacred music
to the ecclesiastical style. But it seems to me
ridiculous to suppose that genius cannot use all good
means with reserve and dignity; and if the modern
church music will not stand comparison in respect
<span class="pb" id="pg_38">[38]</span>
of dignity and solemnity with the old, the fault must
rather lie in the manner in which the new means are
used, than in the means themselves; nor would I
myself concede that there is no place in church for
music which is tinged with a human personality;
I should be rather inclined to reckon the great
musicians among the prophets, and to sympathize
with any one who might prefer the personality of
Beethoven (as revealed in his works) to that of a
good many canonized seers. What is logical is that
we should be careful as to what personality we admit,
and see that the modern means are used with
reserve.</p>
<p>Now if we examine our modern hymn-tunes, do
we find any sign of that reserve of means which we
should expect of genius, or any style which we could
attribute to the personality of a genius? Let any
one in doubt try the following experiment: copy out
some 'favourite tune' in the 'admired manner' of
the present day, and show it to some musician who
may happen not to know it, and ask him if it is not
by Brahms; then see how he will receive any further
remarks that you may make to him on the subject of
music.</p>
<p>These new tunes are in fact, for the most part, the
indistinguishable products of a school given over to
certain mannerisms, and might be produced <i>ad libitum</i>,
<span class="pb" id="pg_39">[39]</span>
as indeed they are; just as were the tunes
of the Lord Mornington school before described:
and though the composers and compilers of these
modern tunes would be the first to deride the exploded
fashion, their own fashion is more foolish, and
promises to be as fugitive<a id="fr_20" href="#fn_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I have said very little in this essay on the words
of hymns. I will venture to add one or two judgements
here. <i>First</i>, that in the Plain-song period,
words and music seem pretty equal and well matched.
<i>Secondly</i>, that in the Reformation period, and for
some time onwards, the musicians did far better
than the sacred poets, and have left us a remainder
of admirable music, for which it is our duty to find
words. <i>Thirdly</i>, that the excuse which some musicians
have offered for the sentimentality of their modern
tunes, namely, that the words are so sentimental,
is not without point as a criticism of modern hymn-words,
<span class="pb" id="pg_40">[40]</span>
but is of no value whatever as a defence
of their practice. The interpretative power of music
is exceedingly great, and can force almost any words
(as far as their sentiment is concerned) into a good
channel.</p>
<p>And if music be introduced at all into public
worship it must be most jealously and scrupulously
guarded. It is a confusion of thought to suppose
that because--as St. Augustin would tell us--it is
not a vital matter to religion whether it employ
music or not, therefore it can be of little consequence
what sort of music is used: and the attitude of
indifference towards it, which has seemed to me
to be almost a point of correct ecclesiastical manners,
must be the expression of a convinced despair, which,
in the present state of things, need not surprise.
Devout persons are naturally afraid of secular ideals,
and shrink from the notion of art intruding into
the sanctuary; and, especially if they have never
learned music, they will share St. Augustin's jealousy
of it; and it is the more difficult to remove their
objections, when what they are innocently suffering
in the name of art curdles the artist's blood with
horror, and keeps him away from church. The artist
too, to whom we might look for help, is the <i>rara
avis in terris</i>, and, in regard to his sympathy with
the clergy, would often be thought by them to deserve
<span class="pb" id="pg_41">[41]</span>
the rest of the hexameter; but it is really to his
credit that he is loth to meddle with church music.
Its social vexations, its eye to the market, its
truckling to vulgar taste and ready subservience
to a dominant fashion, which can never (except
under the rarest combination of circumstances) be
good;--all this is more than enough to hold
him off. Where then is the appeal? <i>Quis custodiet</i>?</p>
<p>The unwillingness of the clergy<a id="fr_21" href="#fn_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
to know anything
about music might be got over if the music
could be set on a proper basis; and in the present
lack of authority and avowed principles, it would
be well if such of our cathedral precentors and
organists as have the matter at heart would consult
and work together with the purpose of instructing
pastors and people by the exhibition of what is good.
This is what we might expect of our religious musical
foundations, which are justifying the standing
condemnation of utilitarian economists so long as the
stipendiaries are content indolently to follow the
<span class="pb" id="pg_42">[42]</span>
fortuitous traditions of the books that lie in the choir,
supplemented by the penny-a-sheet music of the
common shops. In the Universities, too, it should
be impossible for an undergraduate not to gain
acquaintance with good ecclesiastical music, and this
is not ensured by an occasional rare performance
of half a dozen old masterpieces which are preserved
in heartless compliment to antiquity. It is to such
bodies that we must first look for help and guidance
to give our church music artistic importance: for
let no one think that the church can put the artistic
question on one side. There is no escape from art;
art is only the best that man can do, and his second,
third, fourth or fifth best are only worse efforts in
the same direction, and in proportion as they fall
short of the best the more plainly betray their
artificiality. To refuse the best for the sake of
something inferior of the same kind can never be a policy;
it is rather an uncorrected bad habit, that can only
be excused by ignorance; and ignorance on the
question of music is every day becoming less excusable;
and the growing interest and intelligence
which all classes are now showing should force on
religion a better appreciation of her most potent
ally. Music being the universal expression of the
mysterious and supernatural, the best that man has
ever attained to, is capable of uniting in common
<span class="pb" id="pg_43">[43]</span>
devotion minds that are only separated by creeds,
and it comforts our hope with a brighter promise
of unity than any logic offers. And if we consider
and ask ourselves what sort of music we should wish
to hear on entering a church, we should surely, in
describing our ideal, say first of all that it must be
something different from what is heard elsewhere;
that it should be a sacred music, devoted to its
purpose, a music whose peace should still passion,
whose dignity should strengthen our faith, whose
unquestioned beauty should find a home in our
hearts, to cheer us in life and death; a music
worthy of the fair temples in which we meet, and
of the holy words of our liturgy; a music whose
expression of the mystery of things unseen never
allowed any trifling motive to ruffle the sanctity
of its reserve. What power for good such a music
would have!</p>
<p>Now such a music our Church has got, and does
not use; we are content to have our hymn-manuals
stuffed with the sort of music which, merging the
distinction between sacred and profane, seems designed
to make the worldly man feel at home,
rather than to reveal to him something of the life
beyond his knowledge; compositions full of cheap
emotional effects and bad experiments made to be
cast aside, the works of the purveyors of marketable
<span class="pb" id="pg_44">[44]</span>
fashion, always pleased with themselves, and always
to be derided by the succeeding generation.</p>
<hr />
<p>Example is better than precept; and my own
venture as a compiler of a hymn-book has made it
possible for me to say much that otherwise I should
not have said. In <i>The Yattendon Hymnal</i>, printed
by Mr. Horace Hart at the Clarendon Press, Oxford,
and to be had of Mr. Frowde, price 20<i>s.</i>, will be
found a hundred hymns with their music, chosen for
a village choir. The music in this book will show
what sort of a hymnal might be made on my
principles, while the notes at the end of the volume
will illustrate almost every point in this essay which
requires illustration, besides many others. As a
complement to this essay and for advertisement of
the Hymnal I here give the prefaces of that book,
which are as follows:--</p>

The interest of the record must lie in its being of a

St. Augustin in his own case, <i>What tears I shed</i>, &amp;c.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><a id="fn_8" href="#fr_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>It was not an uncommon practice on the Continent
(say from 1540 to 1840), to print books of hymns to be
sung to the current secular airs; and the names or first
lines of these airs were set above the hymn-words as the
musical direction. M. Douen, in his <i>Cl&eacute;ment Marot et le
Psautier Huguenot</i>, vol. i, ch. 22, has given an account of
some of these books; and any one who wishes to follow
this branch of the subject may read his chapter. He does
not notice the later Italian <i>Laude Spirituali</i>,
which might
have supplied incredible monsters to his museum.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><a id="fn_9" href="#fr_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>Besides, the main fault of these books, from which we
should have to quote, is the <i>association</i> of the music, and
this is really an accident, the question before us being the
<i>character</i> of the music; so that we should require musical
illustration, for though the common distinction between
sacred and secular music is in the main just, yet the line
cannot be drawn at the original intention, or historical
origin of the music: the true differentiation lies in the
character of the music, the associated sentiment being
liable to change. If we were to banish from our hymn-books
all the tunes which we know to have a secular
origin, we should have to part with some of the most
sacred and solemn compositions; and where would the
purist obtain any assurance that the tunes which he retained
had a better title? In the sixteenth century, when so many
fine hymn-melodies were written, a musician was working
in the approved manner if he adapted a secular melody, or
at least borrowed a well-known opening phrase: and since
the melodies of that time were composed mainly in conjunct
movement, such initial similarities were unavoidable;
for one may safely say that it very soon became impossible,
under such restrictions, to invent a good opening phrase
which had not been used before. The secular airs, too, of
that time were often as fit for sacred as profane use; and
if I had to find a worthy melody for a good new hymn,
I should seek more hopefully among them than in the
sacred music of our own century.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><a id="fn_10" href="#fr_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>I
may give the following experience without offence.
When I was an undergraduate there was a song from
a comic opera by Offenbach so much in favour as to be <i>de
rigueur</i> at festive meetings. Now there was at the same
time a counterpart of this song popular at evensong in the
churches: it was sung to 'Hark, hark, my soul.' I believe
it is called <i>L'encens des fleurs</i>. They seemed to me both
equally nauseating: it was certainly an accident that
determined which should be sung at worship and which at
wine.

<div class="fndef"><a id="fn_13" href="#fr_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>It would be very damaging to my desire to convince,
if I should seem to deny that the mistaken practice of these
hymn-book compilers was based on the solid ground of
secular common-sense. If anything is true of rhythm it
is this, that the common mind likes common rhythms,
such as the march or waltz, whereas elaboration of rhythm
appeals to a trained mind or artistic faculty. I should say
that the popularity of common rhythms is due to the shortness
of human life, and that if men were to live to be 300
years old they would weary of the sort of music which
Robert Browning describes so well--

<p class="t">'There 's no keeping one's haunches still,</p>
<p class="t">There 's no such pleasure in life.'</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>But hymn-melodies must not be put on that level. It is
desirable to have in church something different from what
goes on outside, and (as I say in the text) a hymn-tune
need not appeal to the lowest understanding on first hearing.
The simple free rhythms, too, are perfectly natural; they
were free-born.</p>
</div>
<div class="fndef"><a id="fn_14" href="#fr_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>I
need only instance Orlando Gibbons' tune called
'Angels.' The original is a most ingenious combination of
rhythms; and its masterly beauty could not be guessed
from the inane form into which it is degraded in <i>Hymns
Ancient and Modern</i>, No. 8.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><a id="fn_15" href="#fr_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>I omit, for want of space,
mention of the late Plain-song

<div class="fndef"><a id="fn_16" href="#fr_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>Comparing
the English with the French Genevan
Psalter, I do not think my judgement is too severe on our
own. It had a few fine tunes original to it; best of all
the cxxxvii (degraded in <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>). This
is of such exceptional beauty that I believe it must have
been written by Bourgeois for Whittingham. Next perhaps
is lxxvii (called 81st in <i>H. A. M.</i>), the original of which,
in Day, 1566, is a fine tune, degraded already in Este,
1592, which version <i>H. A. M.</i> follows: it is said to have
come from Geneva. Besides these, xxv and xliv, which
are the only other tunes from this source in <i>H. A. M.</i>, are
very favourable examples, and I do not think that they
will rescue the book. Nor can I believe that these old
English D.C.M. tunes were ever much used. They are
too much alike for many of them to have been committed
to memory, while all the editions which I happen to have
seen are full of misprints, and the four-line tunes which
drove them out were early in the field, and increased
rapidly.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><a id="fn_17" href="#fr_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>When one turns the pages of that most
depressing of all books ever compiled by the groaning
creature, Julian's hymn-dictionary, and sees the
thousands of carefully tabulated English hymns,
by far the greater number of them not only pitiable
as efforts of human intelligence, but absolutely
worthless as vocal material for melodic treatment,
one wishes that all this effort had been directed to supply
a real want. E. g. the two Wesleys between them wrote
thirteen octavo volumes, of some 400 pages each, full of
closely printed hymns. One must wish that Charles
Wesley at least (who showed in a few instances how well
he could do) had, instead of reeling off all this stuff, concentrated
his efforts to produce only what should be worthy of his talents and
useful to posterity.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><a id="fn_18" href="#fr_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>If old tunes are modernized out of a fine rhythm, a
curious result would be likely to come about; viz. that
modern tunes might be written in the old rhythm for the
sake of novelty, while the old were being sung in the more
modern way for the sake of uniformity.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><a id="fn_19" href="#fr_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>This fact is of course generally recognized. The
explanation in the text is one which was elaborately
illustrated by the Slade Professor at Oxford, in his last

</div>
<div class="fndef"><a id="fn_20" href="#fr_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>There is one point
which I cannot pass over. It has
become the practice in modern books to put marks of
musical expression to the words, directing the congregation
when to sing loud or soft. This implies a habit of
congregational performance the description of which would
make a companion picture to the organ gallery of 1830. It
seems to me a practice of inconceivable degradation: one
asks in trembling if it is to be extended to the Psalms.
It is just as if the congregation were school-children singing
to please a musical inspector, and he a stupid one.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><a id="fn_21" href="#fr_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>It must be due to
unwillingness that comparatively so few of our clergy
can take their part in the service when it

at sight that would suffice a minor canon.

<h3>PREFACE TO THE
<br />YATTENDON HYMNAL</h3>
<p>Among the old melodies which it is the chief object
of this book to restore to use, some will be found
which will be quite new to the public, while others
will be familiar though in a somewhat different form;
and since the sources whence all the tunes are taken
are well known, and have been already largely drawn
upon by the compilers of Psalters and Hymnals, any
melody which is new in this book may be considered
as having been hitherto overlooked or rejected, while
in the alternative case it is to be understood that the
original cast of the melody has at some former time
been altered (frequently to suit the English common
metre to which it was not at first conformable), and
is now restored.</p>
<p>The plain-song tunes, of which an account is given
in the preface to the notes, and the few other old
tunes which do not fall into either of the two
<span class="pb" id="pg_46">[46]</span>
above-mentioned classes, were included for the sake of
their settings.</p>
<p>With respect to the vocal settings in four parts
it may be said that, in the numerous cases in which
such settings were not added by the composer of the
melody, the editors have done their best to supply
the want in a suitable manner, and with some
attempt towards the particular qualities of workmanship
upon which much of the beauty of the old vocal
counterpoint depends; and this latter aim has also
governed the composition of the six tunes not derived
from old sources which have been included in the
work.</p>
<p>This book is offered in no antiquarian spirit. The
greater number of these old tunes are, without question,
of an excellence which sets them above either
the enhancement or the ruin of Time, and at present
when so much attention is given to music it is to be
desired that such masterpieces should not be hidden
away from the public, or only put forth in a corrupt
and degraded form. The excellence of a nation in
music can have no other basis than the education
and practice of the people; and the quality of the
music which is most universally sung must largely
determine the public taste for good or ill.</p>
<p>Since such information as might be looked for in
an introduction is given in the notes at the end of
<span class="pb" id="pg_47">[47]</span>
the volume, there is nothing to add here but a list
of the sources and composers in order of date, which
should in the eyes of musicians go far to justify this
attempt.</p>

<h3>NOTE</h3>
<p>'The seven tunes by Tallis are all transcripts of
his original four-part compositions. Only two of
these tunes are in the common books; one of them
"The Ordinal" is always reset, the other "Canon,"
which is usually sung to Bp. Ken's evening hymn,
is completely altered, the canon being put in a
different position and the harmony changed. This tune
is I believe correctly edited for the first time in the
Y. H. and it is now thus sung at Wells Cathedral.</p>
<p>'Of the eight tunes by Orlando Gibbons, two only
(and these altered both in rhythm and harmony)
appear in the common books. All Gibbons' tunes
are given in the Y. H. with his own bass, the inner
parts being supplied.</p>
<p>'There is a complete list of the music in the word-book
of the Yattendon Hymnal, which is published
by Mr. Blackwell of Broad Street, Oxford, and may
be bought for 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>'</p>

<div class="body">
<h3>THE
<br />PREFACE TO THE NOTES</h3>
<p>The origin of this book was my attempt, when
precentor of a village choir, to provide better settings
of the hymns than those in use.</p>
<p>When I gave up my office, I printed the first
twenty-five hymns for the convenience of the choir,
and also for the sake of the tunes by Jeremy Clark,
which I had been at some pains to restore, and for
the preservation of the tunes composed on our behalf
by Professor Wooldridge.</p>
<p>My choice of music had so far been limited to
tunes, for which suitable words were to be found in
<i>Hymns Ancient &amp; Modern</i>; but by the time that these
first tunes were printed, I determined to continue
the book free of this restriction, and, from whatever
source, to provide words for tunes which I had hitherto
been unable to use. I then became aware of a real
cause for the absence of most of these tunes from
the common hymnals: <i>there were no words of any kind
to which they could be sung</i>. Having already translated
<span class="pb" id="pg_51">[51]</span>
some of the old Latin hymns for their proper melodies,
I was thence led on to the more difficult task
of supplying the greater need of these other tunes;
the result being that over forty of these hundred
hymns have english words newly written by myself.
Almost all of these new hymns are in some sense
translations, for even where an original hymn could
not be followed in its entirety, as an old Latin hymn
generally may be, there was usually a foundation to
begin upon, and I never failed to find the music
conditioning, dictating, or inspiring the remainder.
I did not willingly engage in this, nor until I had
searched word-books of all kinds; a fruitless labour,
unless for the hope begotten thereof that my practice
in versifying and my love for music may together
have created something of at least relative value.</p>
<p>The unusual method which I was constrained to
follow, that is of writing words to suit existing music,
has its advantages. In some cases, as will be seen in
the notes to the hymns, the musician, out of despair
or even contempt for the doggrel offered to him,
has composed a fine tune quite independent of the
words to which it was dedicated<a id="fr_22" href="#fn_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>, and such tunes
have been silent ever since they were composed:
while even when a melody has been actually inspired
<span class="pb" id="pg_52">[52]</span>
by a particular hymn, the attention of the composer
to the first stanza has not infrequently set up a hirmos,
or at least a musical scheme of feeling, which,
not having been in the mind of the writer of the
words, is not carried out in his other stanzas<a id="fr_23" href="#fn_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>:
indeed, as every one must have observed, the words
of hymns have too often been written with insufficient
attention to the conditions which a repetition of any
music to every stanza must impose. To get rid of
such discrepancies between words and music is
advantageous to both, and although this treatment
cannot of course be applied to english hymns,--which
it is not allowable to alter, except in cases of glaring
unfitness or absurdity, such as would if uncorrected
cause the neglect of a good hymn<a id="fr_24" href="#fn_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>,--yet, where the
<span class="pb" id="pg_53">[53]</span>
hymn has to be translated from a foreign language,
some reconstruction is generally inevitable, and it
can follow no better aim than that of the mutual
enforcement of words and music. And the words
owe a courtesy to the music; for if a balance be
struck between the words and music of hymns, it will
be found to be heavily in favour of the musicians,
whose fine work has been unscrupulously altered and
reduced to dullness by english compilers, with the
object of conforming it in rhythm to words that are
unworthy of any music whatever. The chief offenders
here are the protestant reformers, whose metrical
psalms, which the melodies were tortured to fit,
exhibit greater futility than one would look for even
in men who could thus wantonly spoil fine music<a id="fr_25" href="#fn_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The form and size of the book were determined
by the type, chosen because it was the only one that
I could find of any beauty; and I wished that my
book should in this respect give an example, and be
worthy both of the music and its sacred use<a id="fr_26" href="#fn_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>. Moreover
<span class="pb" id="pg_54">[54]</span>
a book from which two or three singers can
read is more convenient in the choir than a multiplicity
of small books; and the music being in full
score, its intention cannot be mistaken: for it must
be understood that most of these tunes are set in the
manner proper for voices, but unsuitable for the piano
or other keyed instrument; and the book is intended
to encourage unaccompanied singing. A choir that
cannot sing unaccompanied cannot sing at all; and
this is not an uncommon condition in our churches,
where choirs with varying success accompany the
organ. A proper manner of sustained singing, and
the true artistic pleasure that should govern it, will
never be obtained until these conditions are reversed.</p>
<p>There is one novelty which I am responsible for
introducing, namely the four-part vocal settings of
certain early plain-song melodies. The later plain-song
tunes, such as No. 44, are, I suppose<a id="fr_27" href="#fn_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>, as fit
for this treatment as any other tunes of the same
date; but in the case of the earlier melodies, which
<span class="pb" id="pg_55">[55]</span>
were composed before the invention of any complete
system of harmony, it is generally agreed that they
should be sung in unison, in fact the more elaborate
of them cannot be sung otherwise. To give four-part
settings of any of these early tunes calls therefore
for an explanation, which I will give as briefly as
possible.</p>
<p>When these tunes are sung, they are usually accompanied,
and this implies a harmonic treatment.
Now the best harmonic treatment which they can
have is the Palestrinal, because that was the earliest
complete system, and therefore the nearest to their
time, and also because we may rely on the truth of
its interpretation of the modes for the reason that
Palestrina had never heard any music that was not
modal. A modern musician, if he attempts to go
back beyond Palestrina, must draw on his imagination,
and while his aim must be to produce something
artistically and technically less perfect than
Palestrina's system, his work, when it is done, will
carry neither authority nor conviction.</p>
<p>If then we take Palestrina's harmonic interpretation
of the modes, it seems to me that there can be no
objection to giving vocal parts to the simpler hymns.
If it is preferred to sing them in unison, the modal
settings will be a guide to the accompanist. But it
is my opinion that such settings as I offer will really
<span class="pb" id="pg_56">[56]</span>
please, and they may possibly do something to bring
these tunes, which have a unique, unmatchable beauty,
into favour with choirs that dislike the effort and
waste of unison singing. These settings offer no
difficulty of execution all; <i>that is necessary is that the
under voices should know the melody</i>: and though this
is not generally thought requisite in a modern hymn,
it is asking nothing extra of a choir that would sing
the plain-song tunes; for even if they are sung in
unison, they must first be known by heart (otherwise
their rhythmical freedom, which defies notation, and
is indispensable to their beauty, cannot be approached),
and when once a choir has got thus far, the under
parts, being phrased with the melody, will easily
follow it. An explanation of the notation of these
settings is given in the note to Hymn 29. Congregational
singing of hymns is much to be desired;
but, though difficult to obtain, it is not permissible
to provoke it by undignified music. Its only sound
musical basis is good melody: good melodies should
therefore be offered to the people, such as it has been
the object of this book to bring together; and they
should have as much freedom and variety of rhythm
as possible. If some of the good melodies are, owing
to their wide compass or other difficulty, unfit for
congregational singing, this is an advantage; because
neither are all hymn-words equally suitable. Most
<span class="pb" id="pg_57">[57]</span>
of the words in this book are suitable for congregational
singing; some are not. A hymn-book which
is intended entirely for congregational use must be
faulty in one of two ways; either it will offer for
congregational singing hymns whose sacred and intimate
character is profaned by such a treatment, or
it will have to omit some of the most beautiful hymns
in the language: but congregations differ much, not
only with regard to the music in which they are
capable of joining, but also as to the sort of words
which best express their religious emotion.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the following notes the left-hand side of the
page is given to the words, the right to the music
of each hymn: in the latter column will be found
full information as to the text of the music, the
source whence it is derived, &amp;c., together with a
careful account of every departure that has been made
from the originals. It is hoped that this will not
only be of general interest, but that it may inspire
confidence in the text of the book, and ensure the
reception which its authority demands. For the text
of the music, and all the statements in the notes,
I am responsible; excepting those portions of the
notes which are therein assigned to their proper
authorities, and in these I am responsible for the
correctness of the quotations and references, in which
<span class="pb" id="pg_58">[58]</span>
I have done my best to secure accuracy. I owe much
to the kindness of Mr. W. Barclay Squire at the
British Museum; I have also to thank Mr. Godfrey
Arkwright for the loan of some rare books, and
Dr. Chas. Wood of Cambridge for two settings and
occasional reading of music proofs; in which latter
task I gratefully record the help of Mr. J. S. Liddle
and Dr. Percy Buck. To Mr. Miles Birket Foster
I owe the three trios by Jeremy Clark, and to the
Revs. W. H. Frere and G. H. Palmer the text of the
plain-song melodies, and the information concerning
them which is given in the following notes: it is due
to the generosity with which they put their learning
and judgement at my disposal that I am able to offer
these tunes with the same confidence as the rest of
the book. Professor Wooldridge, having co-operated
with me throughout, has allowed his name to appear
on the title page.</p>

57 is a good example. The line <i>Du bist mein,
und ich bin dein</i>, corresponds in stanza 2 with <i>Wenn die
Welt in Tr&uuml;mmer fallt</i>, and in stanza 4 with <i>Elend, Noth,
Kreuz, Schmach und Tod</i>. Again in No. 77 the opening
phrase, <i>Mon Dieu, mon Dieu</i>, of the twenty-second psalm needs
music which conditions the other stanzas severely. Again
the weak apologetic latter half of the German hymn
<i>Herzliebster Jesu</i>, No. 42, is irreconcilably out of the key with
the pathetic grief of the beginning. Cases in which
caesuras and grammatical breaks are inconsistent are
numberless.

of our common hymn-books, nor is their ugliness the cause
of their cheapness. If many copies of a book are sold,
they can be sold cheaply; if only a few, then the initial
expense, which is much the same whether the book be
beautiful or ugly, must be shared between those few buyers
and the author. But thus it comes about indirectly for
cheapness to be the cause of meanness and ugliness,
because in a larger market there is greater indifference to
artistic excellence of all kinds, and from habit a preference
for what is inferior. In a large edition this book could be
sold as cheaply as another.
